Malwatch is a malware scanner primarily designed for web server environments. It is battle proven and in production with some of the internet's busiest websites.

This repo stores community malware signatures kindly released by various vendors and individuals. Contributions are welcome and we greatly appreciate the community to review reported issues.

The usefulness of malwatch is proportionate to the signature base. Please consider sharing so that others may benefit.
